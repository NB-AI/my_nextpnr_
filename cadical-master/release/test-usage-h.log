usage: cadical [ <option> ... ] [ <input> [ <proof> ] ]

where '<option>' is one of the following common options:

  -h             print this short list of common options
  --help         print complete list of all options
  --version      print version

  -n             do not print witness
  -v             increase verbosity
  -q             be quiet

  -t <sec>       set wall clock time limit

The input is read from '<input>' assumed to be in DIMACS format.
Incremental 'p inccnf' files are supported too with cubes at the end.
If '<proof>' is given then a DRAT proof is written to that file.
